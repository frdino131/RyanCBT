        Great, let's continue. I hope you are still using your daily mood scale. By now you have most likely finished an entire sheet, so I'm going to have my friend give you another for this coming week. When you are ready to continue, say ready.(ready)

        Great! I want you to try and pay attention to the patterns in your mood day to day. It might teach you something. Also, you should have been keeping track of the number of positive and negative thoughts throughout the day. This is important because we want to encourage healthy thinking. A good way to do this is to focus on thoughts that produce a better mood. You could increase the number of good thoughts in your mind such as making a list of good things about you and your life. You should also not be afraid to pat yourself on the back sometimes. A lot of what we do isn't noticed by others so you should give yourself credit for what you do. Another good thing to do is take breaks. Allow your mind to relax so your body can feel at peace. Feeling at peace can give you energy. Finally, consider the future. Imagine yourself taking steps toward a time when things are better. Let's try an exercise. Tell me some positive things about yourself.

		I see. I think normally it feels much better thinking this way rather than negatively. We actually want to try and decrease those thoughts that make us feel bad. If a thought is ruining your mood, you should strive to identify this and tell yourself to think of something that won't disrupt your well being. What are some things you can do to accomplish this?

        I see, let's continue. I want to discuss an alternate approach to work through your thoughts that I feel can be really rewarding. You can think of it like talking back to the thought that is hurting you. This method is called the A-B-C-D method. A stands for the activating event. B is the belief you have. C stands for consequence. Finally, D is the way you dispute the thought. Another way to look at it is consider what happened, what do you tell yourself about what happened, how do you feel as a result, and how you talk back to the thought. I've prepared a printout for you to read and use to practice this method. Do you have any questions?(yes|no)

        Good! This may seem silly or confusing, but once we walk through some examples, it will make more sense. To practice, pretend I'm feeling down because I was diagnosed with diabetes. In this situation, this is the A part of the method because it is a fact and something causing my sadness. Of these two choices, which do you think applies to the belief part of the method?(My diabetes is Type II|Diabetes will ruin my life)

        Good try <get name = "name"/>, but I think the other answer would've been better. This answer is a fact about my diabetes and would be better for the A part of the method, rather than a belief I hold. Let's try the next part. Which statement is a consequence of my thought?(I am feeling very sad thinking about my diabetes|No one can be happy if they are diagnosed with diabetes)

        Great! This is a consequence of my thoughts because my negative thoughts are causing me to feel sad. Let's finish this exercise by looking at the final letter of the A-B-C-D method. Do you have any ideas on how I could dispute my negative thoughts about having diabetes?

        Nice try, but I think this answer is more of a belief than a consequence. Me feeling sad is a direct consequence of my negative thoughts about diabetes.

        Let's continue. Here's one I thought of. "I now have diabetes, but can still live a satisfying life." In fact, this statement is equal parts true as it is optimistic. I hope this exercise made it easier to understand the method. You've been doing great <get name = "name"/>! Believe it or not, we've already been through 4 sessions. This wraps up our section about how thoughts affect your mood. To summarize how important thoughts are, I am going to show you a video about the science behind them.

        I'm glad you got something meaningful out of it! As we've talked about, our thoughts are incredibly important to our health and well-being. Next time, we are going to begin looking at how activities affect our mood. Until our next session, try and practice the ABCD method and work on your daily mood scale. Great job today! Goodbye!
