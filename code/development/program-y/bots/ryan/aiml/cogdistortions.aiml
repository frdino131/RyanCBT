        Good job! It may be easy to think that a single instance defines you, but that is never the case. You are a multifaceted person who has years of experience and life to define you. you just have to realize that the moment has passed so you can forgive yourself for it. Easier said than done, right? Sometimes reevaluating a situation can help. For example, if your negative thought was "I didn't do well with that job interview so I'm therefore horrible at job interviews", you can restate that as 'I didn't do so well on that job interview, but I'll be sure to do better next time'. By changing that thought in your mind, you'll start to see how overgeneralizing applies. Try and tell me about the situation again in a way that minimizes overgeneralization.

        Excellent job in identifying a distortion! When it comes to control fallacies, they can either be external or internal. An external control fallacies are when you assume everything that happens to you is outside your control and internal control fallacies are when you assume everything that happens to you is your fault. In reality, things that happen to you are always a combination of internal and external factors. To help see this, we can discuss a negative situation that applies. </template>

These can be either 'I should...' or 'They should...' or 'It should...'. These should statements are little rules you have about yourself or others and if you violate them even a little bit you start to feel bad. Oftentimes, these should statements are impossible to abide by, such as 'I should always try my hardest'. See how that statement sets up someone for failure; it's impossible to always try your hardest in everything you do.

        That's great <get name = "name"/>! Don't forget that no one is perfect and you don't always have to be right. Did you want to try and work on another distortion?

        Understandable. Great job today. I know we went over a lot, but we will keep reinforcing what you learned in future sessions. I'll see you next time <get name = "name"/>. Goodbye! </template>

        In the heaven's reward fallacy, you feel that there should be a reward after a time of sacrifice and self-denial. When that reward doesn't come, you feel bitter and disappointed. Do you feel like this fallacy applies to you?

        Excellent job in identifying a fallacy. The best way to combat this fallacy is to realize that you are the only one responsible for your actions, and that a reward for self sacrifice or self-denial is not on the way. To better understand this, tell me about a negative situation and we can break it down.  </template>

        Great! Now when you think about this, what do you expect will be your reward?

        I see. Just remember that there is no guarantee that you receive this reward. What you can do is control what reward you give to yourself or what you do assuming you won't be rewarded. Try and rewrite your thought with that in mind.

        That's great <get name = "name"/>! Hopefully this exercise helped explain the fallacy better and showed how it applies to your own thoughts. Do you want to work on any others?
